## Introduction

Earlier this year, the Chicago Python Meetup Group held a workshop on CircuitPython. I entered an idea to build an activity monitor for the workshop and was selected to participate and received a Circuit Playground Express.

The Circuit Playground Express offers a number of built-in sensors, an accelerometer, LEDs, and buttons. You can do a lot with just the microcontroller itself and I found it much easier to work with than the Arduino. There are also various ways to code it (MakeCode, CircuitPython, Arduino, Code.orgâ€™s CS Discoveries), for this project I used CircuitPython. I learned a lot about electronics and coding for electronics and wanted to briefly show the activity monitor.
