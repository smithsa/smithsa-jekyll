<p>While at Shaker, I was tasked with developing the corporate and career site of a professional recruiting services provider called Harmer. The website features an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) integration with Bullhorn, which houses all of Harmer’s clients’ positions. It is a highly responsive site, fluid across all devices.</p>
<p>Some technologies and languages included in the development of Harmer’s website include PHP, JavaScript, JQuery, HTML, SASS, AJAX and an API integration. Additionally, the site uses Wordpress as its content management system, using a custom built template and fields and is built on the Foundation Framework. The website was built using PHP, Ajax, Javascript, JQuery, SASS, and HTML.</p>
