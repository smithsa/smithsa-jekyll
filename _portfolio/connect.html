<p>Connect is a game of questions that creates honest conversation. A spinoff to the game 21 Questions, Connect is a great game to get to know someone better through honest conversation starters. The app was built using Apache Cordova. The application was derived from a web application I built called <a href="https://polar-cliffs-2133.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">The And Remixed</a> that was developed using a PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and Ajax, Javascript.</p>
