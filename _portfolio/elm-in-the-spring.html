<p>Elm in the Spring is a single-track, single-day conference for developers who love Elm. Elm is a functional,strongly typed, reactive, and event-driven front-end language that compiles to Javascript. As an organizer of the conference, I designed and developed the conference website for 2020. The site was designed and built fairly quickly and developed primarily using Elm and Sass.</p>
