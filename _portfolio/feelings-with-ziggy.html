<p>Feelings with Ziggy is an Alexa Skill built with Python. It was built for an Alexa Skills challenge, and is an educational game that aims to enhance the emotional literacy of young children by placing emotions to common experiences, ultimately helping children identify and express what they are feeling. This skill was built with AWS Lambda. Additionally it uses a s3 Bucket, Amazon EC2, and Amazon RDS (running an API I built with PHP and MySQL).</p>
